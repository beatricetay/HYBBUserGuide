== Introduction

*HealthyBaby* (HYBB) is a desktop application that provides you with a database of quick, easy, and healthy recipes.
Are you a *university student* staying on campus and are tired of purchasing the same few unhealthy meals? Looking for
healthier options but searching for and planning recipes are a hassle for you? HYBB is just the app for you!
HYBB helps alleviate the challenges faced while maintaining healthy eating habits, easing the transition from eating
out everyday to cooking healthy meals regularly.

*Value proposition*: Focuses on healthy, simple recipes with short cooking time with ingredients filter to
minimise food wastage.

HYBB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Through our convenient filters, searching and planning for new healthy recipes will be a breeze.

Get motivated through our eye-catching goals and achievements.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Overview (Harshita)
The main features of HYBB are as follows:

=== Filter

reduce the time needed to find recipes that suit your needs.

=== Planning
This feature enables students to plan their meals in advance and provides an easy grocery list for your shopping needs.

=== Goals
This feature enables students to monitor their healthy eating progress, HYBB provides a history of all cooked meals along with
statistics based on 4 main goals: ‚ÄúWholesome Wholemeals‚Äù, ‚ÄúBulk like a Hulk‚Äù, ‚ÄúHerbivore‚Äù and "Fruity Fiesta".

=== Achievements

== Notations Used
=== List of Tags
You can use the following tags to converse with HYBB.

|===
|Tag |Description

|n/ |Name of recipe
|t/ |Time taken to prepare and cook recipe, measured in minutes
|ig/ |Grain ingredient (e.g. rice, bread, spaghetti)
|iv/ |Vegetable ingredient (e.g. spinach, cabbage, carrot)
|ip/ |Protein ingredient (e.g. chicken, salmon, tofu)

|s/ |Steps of the recipe
|===

=== Legend
From sections 6 to 11, the following notations may be used.

[cols="1a,1"]
|===
|Notation |Meaning

|[ ] |Necessary field
|< > |Optional field. e.g. `n/name <s/step>` can be used as `n/Spicy Chicken s/Step 1` or just `n/Spicy Chicken`
|[ < > ] |At least one of the optional fields is necessary
|‚Ä¶ | One or more of this same field can be added. +
e.g. if the command specifies `<ip/protein>...`, you may either leave
the field empty, or you may specify one or more protein ingredients. +
e.g. if the command specifies `[recipe index]...`, you may specify one or more _recipe indexes_.
|üí° | Tips for usage and things to take note of
|===


[TIP]
Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/name t/time`, `t/time n/name` is also acceptable. +
Also, commands are case-insensitive, but tags are case-sensitive.

<<content-page,Back to Top>>

[[Features]]
== Basic Commands

=== Viewing help : `help`
Gives you a short summary of all the available commands. +
Format: `help`

=== Switch the current tab: `switch` (Harshita)
Switches the current tab you are in and changes the display. +
Format: `switch` [tab name]

Example: `switch planning` +
Switches the current tab to the planning tab.

[TIP]
Tabs available: recipes, planning, goals, achievements.

=== List all recipes: `list`
Lists all the recipes present in the database. +
Format: `list`

=== Find a recipe: `find` (Brian)
Searches for existing recipes by their names using the keyword(s) that you have specified. +
Format: `find </strict> [keyword] <keyword>...`

Example 1: `find /strict Avocado Chicken` +
Finds recipes that contain the words "Avocado" *or* "Chicken" in their names (ie. only one of them has to be present).

[TIP]
Using `/strict` will treat all subsequent keywords as *separate keywords* (separated by the space),
as seen in Example 1. +
{nbsp} +
It will also search for an *exact match* of each specified keyword (e.g. If you are searching for a recipe that
has "Avocado" in its name, `find /strict Avo` _will not_ be able to find it. Instead, use `find /strict Avocado` or
see Example 2)

Example 2: `find Avocado Chicken` +
Finds recipes that contain the single keyword "Avocado Chicken".

[TIP]
Without `/strict`, all the keywords will be taken as a *single keyword* and it *does not* require an exact match for a
recipe to be found (e.g. `find Avo` will be able to find recipes that has "Avocado" in its name)

=== Add a recipe: `add`
Adds a recipe to the recipe book +
Format: `add [n/name] [t/time] [<ig/grain>... <iv/vegetable>... <ip/protein>... <if/fruit>... <io/other>...]
<s/step>...`

Example: `add n/Chicken Rice t/30 ip/300g, Chicken Thigh ig/300g, Rice s/Boil chicken
          s/While chicken is cooking, add sesame oil and crushed ginger into rice and cook it
          s/When chicken is done, dip it into iced water
          s/Serve while rice is hot` +
Adds a new recipe entry that contains the following description:

.Expected output
image::AddExampleOne.png[]

[WARNING]
Multiple steps and multiple ingredients for a recipe can be added. +
However, multiple 'name' and 'time' cannot be added. +
HYBB will take the latter input for these fields. +
For example, `add n/Chicken Rice n/Chicken with Rice t/25 t/30, ip/300g, Chicken Thigh`
would create a new recipe with the name Chicken with Rice and the time 30 minutes. +

[TIP]
To create a recipe, you need to specify the *name and time* of the recipe and *at least one ingredient*
that was used.

[TIP]
For recipes with many ingredients and steps, you can add them separately using
our <<Recipe Customisation Commands (Brian), recipe customation commands>>. +

=== Edit a recipe : `edit`
Edits an existing recipe. This is the command used for editing entire fields at a time. +
Format: `edit [recipe index] [<n/name> <t/time> <ig/grain>... <iv/vegetable>... <ip/protein>... <if/fruit>...
<io/other>... <s/step>...]`

Example: `edit 4 n/Chicken Rice t/20` +
Renames the 4th recipe to Chicken Rice, and sets the preparation time to 20 minutes (from whatever amount it was before).

[WARNING]
Using this command to edit a field that might have multiple entities like ‚Äòvegetable ingredients‚Äô or 'steps' will
overwrite the entire field.
For example, if the 4th recipe currently has a list of 5 vegetable ingredients, running `edit 4 iv/50g, Lettuce` will
replace the *entire* list of vegetable ingredients with only 50g of Lettuce. +

[TIP]
To make changes to a single entity in a field without having to rewrite everything, please refer to our
<<Recipe Customisation Commands (Brian), recipe customation commands>>. +

[WARNING]
HYBB will take the latter input if more than one 'name' or more than one 'time' is given. +
For example, `edit 4 n/FirstName n/SecondName t/10 t/20`
would change the name to SecondName and the time to 20 minutes for the recipe at _recipe index_ 4.

=== Delete a recipe : `delete` (Brian)
Deletes the recipe(s) that you have specified. +
Format: `delete [recipe index] <recipe index>...`

Example: `delete 1 3 4` +
Deletes recipe 1, 3, and 4 from the recipe book.

[TIP]
You can *delete, favourite, or unfavourite* multiple recipes at the same time (at least one recipe must be selected).

[TIP]
If you specify a recipe number that does not exist in the list of recipes _that you are currently viewing_, none of your
selected recipes will be deleted, favourited, or unfavourited.

=== Favourite a recipe: `favourite` (Brian)
Favourites the recipe(s) that you have specified. +
Format: `favourite [recipe index] <recipe index>...`

Example: `favourite 1 3 4` +
Favourites recipes 1, 3, and 4.

=== Unfavourite a recipe: `unfavourite` (Brian)
Unfavourites the recipe(s) that you have specified. +
Format: `unfavourite [recipe index] <recipe index>...`

Example: `unfavourite 1 3 4` +
Unfavourites recipes 1, 3, and 4.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo a previous action: `undo` (Brian)
Undoes a previous action. +
Format: `undo <number of actions> or <all>`

Example 1: `undo` +
Undoes only the previous action.

Example 2: `undo 3` +
Undoes the 3 previous actions. If there are less than 3 actions to undo, you will not be allowed to undo.

Example 3: `undo all` +
Undoes all previous actions.

[TIP]
For both undo and redo, the number of actions that you specify (if any) has to be a non-zero unsigned integer!

=== Redo a previous undo: `redo` (Brian)
Restores actions that have been previously undone using `undo`.
Format: `redo <number of actions> or <all>`

Example 1: `redo` +
Restores the actions that have been undone by the previous undo.

Example 2: `redo 3` +
Restores the actions that have been undone by the previous 3 undo-s. If there are less than 3 actions to restore, you
not be allowed to redo.

Example 3: `redo all` +
Restores the actions that have been undone by all previous undo-s.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clear the recipe book : `clear`
Clears the recipe book. After entering this command, the recipe book will be empty and all planned recipes
will be removed. +
Format: `clear`

[WARNING]
All recipes and plans, including default ones, will be removed.

[TIP]
You can `undo` this command if it was performed by accident.

=== Exit the program : `exit`

=== Saving the data
HYBB's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

<<content-page,Back to Top>>

// tag::recipecustomisation[]
== Recipe Customisation Commands (Brian)
As we see from the `edit` command in section 6.6, if you want to add, edit, or delete a single ingredient or step,
you would have to rewrite the whole field that you wish to edit. This would be troublesome if the field contains
multiple ingredients or steps that you may not necessarily want to edit. Therefore, the following commands are used in
occasions like these!

=== Add Ingredients to a Recipe: `addIngredient` (Brian)
Adds more ingredients to an existing recipe. +
Format: `addIngredient [recipe index] [<ig/grain>... <iv/vegetable>... <ip/protein>... <if/fruit>... <io/other>...]`

Example: `addIngredient 2 ig/50g, Bread io/5g, Butter` +
Adds 50g of Bread and 5g of Butter to recipe 2.

[TIP]
You can add multiple ingredients at a time (at least one ingredient must be added).

[TIP]
If you add an ingredient that already exists in the recipe, that existing ingredient will be replaced with the new one.

=== Edit Ingredient Quantity in a Recipe: `editIngredient` (Brian)
Edits the quantity of an ingredient in an existing recipe. +
Format: `editIngredient [recipe index] [<ig/grain>... <iv/vegetable>... <ip/protein>... <if/fruit>‚Ä¶ <io/other>...]`

Example: `editIngredient 3 ig/50g, Bread` +
Searches for Bread in recipe 3 and changes its quantity to 50g. An error message will appear if Bread does not exist in
recipe 3's ingredients set.

[TIP]
You can edit multiple ingredients at a time (at least one ingredient must be edited).

=== Delete Ingredients in a Recipe: `deleteIngredient` (Brian)
Deletes the specified ingredient(s) from an existing recipe. +
Format: `deleteIngredient [recipe index] [<ig/grain name>... <iv/vegetable name>... <ip/protein name>...
<if/fruit name>... <io/other name>...]`

Example: `deleteIngredient 3 ig/Rice iv/Kailan` +
Searches for Rice and Kailan in recipe 3 and deletes them. An error message will appear if Rice and/or Kailan does not
exist in recipe 3's ingredients set.

[TIP]
You can delete multiple ingredients at a time (at least one ingredient must be deleted).

[TIP]
There is no need to specify quantity here. Just the ingredient name will do!

[TIP]
If you type an ingredient prefix (e.g. "ig/") but don't specify any ingredients, all ingredients of that type will be
deleted.

=== Add Steps to a Recipe: `addStep` (Brian)
Adds more steps to an existing recipe. +
Format: `addStep [recipe index] [s/step] <s/next step>...`

Example: `addStep 1 s/New step s/Another new step` +
Adds 2 new steps to recipe 1.

[TIP]
You can add multiple steps at a time (at least one step must be added).

=== Edit a Step in a Recipe: `editStep` (Brian)
Edits the specified step in an existing recipe. +
Format: `editStep [recipe index] [step index] [s/new step]`

Example: `editStep 3 4 s/Edited new step` +
Replaces step 4 of recipe 3 with ‚ÄúEdited new step‚Äù. If you specify more than one step, only the first one will be used
to replace the old step.

=== Delete Steps in a Recipe: `deleteStep` (Brian)
Deletes the specified step(s) from an existing recipe. +
Format: `deleteStep [recipe index] [step index] <step index>...`

Example: `deleteStep 3 2 3 5` +
Deletes steps 2, 3, and 5 of recipe 3.

[TIP]
You can delete multiple steps at a time (at least one step must be deleted).
// end::recipecustomisation[]

<<content-page,Back to Top>>

// tag::advancedfilter[]
== Filter Command (Brian)
This command is not to be confused with the `Find` command, which only searches for recipes by their names. The
`Filter` command is a more robust search command that allows you to search for recipes using _various criteria_.

[TIP]
You can combine the input of the next few subsections to filter the recipes by multiple criteria!

=== Filter by ingredients (Brian)

== FAQ (Harshita)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the
data of your previous HYBB folder.

*Q*: How does the auto-generation of goals work? +
*A*: HYBB analyses the ingredients added or edited in a recipe and auto-generates goals for you. The recipe being tagged by a goal suggests that the minimum requirement per meal for the respective food group, as recommended by the National Institute of Health, has been met.

*Q*: Why is there a deleteGoal command and no addGoal command? +
*A*: As this is the beta version of HYBB, the auto-generation of goals is designed to either accurately calculate quantity or err on the side of overestimation. This would allow you to remove any goal you deem inaccurate based on your own judgement. You can look forward to future releases which will integrate artificial intelligence into HYBB to auto-generate goals more accurately!

*Q*: Why are there no safeguards for adding ingredients? +
*A*: Currently, HYBB is designed to help you manage your customized recipe list. Hence, the addition of ingredients and under which tag(ip/ iv/ ig/ if/ io/) they fall would be solely based on your judgement! For future releases, we will ensure more safeguards to prevent invalid inputs based on common knowledge.

*Q*: What are _recipe indexes_, _step indexes_ and _plan indexes_? +
*A*: Recipe indexes_ are the numbers beside each recipe in the 'Recipes' tab. +
Step indexes_ are the numbers beside each step in a Recipe. +
Plan indexes_ are the numbers beside each plan in the 'Planning' tab.

For example, in the diagram below, 'Asian BBQ Chicken' is at _recipe index_ 1, with the step
"In a bowl, mix all the ingredients ..." at _step index_ 1.
